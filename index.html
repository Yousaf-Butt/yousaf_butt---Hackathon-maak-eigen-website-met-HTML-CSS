          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm just a dude who recently discovered a new passion for
            programming and web development. I'm really into retrogaming,
            especially games from the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. This site is
            dedicated to the aesthetics of the late 80's/early 90's video games.
            Oh, and I really dig the anime art style of that time period too!

            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>
              In my younger days I had a talent for drawing, and after growing
              up I studied graphic design for a while. These days I'm interested
              in web design and digital arts. I hope to become a proficient
              designer one day. You're never too old to learn and do something
              different.

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
              When I was a kid, I was a proud owner of an MSX2 home computer. I
              used to do simple programming in MSX-BASIC, a dialect of the BASIC
              programming language. After that I lost interest until a few
              months ago. I discovered Python and it really is fun to learn this
              language. Let's see what the future will bring. Maybe I'll create
              a video game? That would be awesome!
